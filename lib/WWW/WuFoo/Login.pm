# ABSTRACT: The Login API is designed to allow approved partners access to user’s API keys given an email, password and (optionally) a subdomain. In other words, this API gives you the ability to gather the API key for a user without them having to visit Wufoo. This keeps your user engaged in your process because they don’t have to leave your site.
